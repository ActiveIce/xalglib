        LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

DESCRIPTION:
The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
of memory.
The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
value of order 2*N*M.


REQUIREMENTS:
Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
* function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
   and other functions
3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem
   with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension. N>0
    M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                performance. M<=N.
    X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    

NOTES:
1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
   optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
   use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
   L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

/*************************************************************************
The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinLBFGSCreate().  It  uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinLBFGSCreate() in  order  to  get
more information about creation of LBFGS optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                performance. M<=N.
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
   Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
   nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

/*************************************************************************
This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  LBFGS  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinLBFGSSetPrec...()
functions.

There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

This function sets low-rank preconditioner for Hessian matrix  H=D+W'*C*W,
where:
* H is a Hessian matrix, which is approximated by D/W/C
* D is a NxN diagonal positive definite matrix
* W is a KxN low-rank correction
* C is a KxK positive definite diagonal factor of low-rank correction

This preconditioner is inexact but fast - it requires O(N*K)  time  to  be
applied. Preconditioner P is calculated by artificially constructing a set
of BFGS updates which tries to reproduce behavior of H:
* Sk = Wk (k-th row of W)
* Yk = (D+Wk'*Ck*Wk)*Sk
* Yk/Sk are reordered by ascending of C[k]*norm(Wk)^2

Here we assume that rows of Wk are orthogonal or nearly orthogonal,  which
allows us to have O(N*K+K^2) update instead of O(N*K^2) one. Reordering of
updates is essential for having good performance on non-orthogonal problems
(updates which do not add much of curvature are added first,  and  updates
which add very large eigenvalues are added last and override effect of the
first updates).

In practice, this preconditioner is perfect when ortogonal  correction  is
applied; on non-orthogonal problems sometimes  it  allows  to  achieve  5x
speedup (when compared to non-preconditioned solver).

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic gradient.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlbfgsoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.
           
           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.
      
INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep>0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.
                    
                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minlbfgssetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================                    

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.
      
      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.
      
      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.
      
      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.
  
=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

/*************************************************************************
Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minlbfgsoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minlbfgsoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================
    
Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

INPUT PARAMETERS:

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.
      
      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.
      
      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
gradient computed during line search.

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.
