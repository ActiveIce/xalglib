Pearson's correlation coefficient significance test

This test checks hypotheses about whether X  and  Y  are  samples  of  two
continuous  distributions  having  zero  correlation  or   whether   their
correlation is non-zero.

The following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - X and Y have zero correlation)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the correlation  coefficient  is
      greater than or equal to 0)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the correlation coefficient  is
      less than or equal to 0).

Requirements:
    * the number of elements in each sample is not less than 5
    * normality of distributions of X and Y.

Input parameters:
    R   -   Pearson's correlation coefficient for X and Y
    N   -   number of elements in samples, N>=5.

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient significance test

This test checks hypotheses about whether X  and  Y  are  samples  of  two

      less than or equal to 0).

Requirements:
    * the number of elements in each sample is not less than 5.

The test is non-parametric and doesn't require distributions X and Y to be
normal.

Input parameters:

    N   -   number of elements in samples, N>=5.
