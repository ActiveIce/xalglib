        NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

DESCRIPTION:
The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


REQUIREMENTS:
Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
* function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
   other functions
3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
   with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

/*************************************************************************
The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
information about creation of CG optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
   Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
   nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

/*************************************************************************
This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

/*************************************************************************
This function allows to suggest initial step length to the CG algorithm.

Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It
can be useful when you have  badly  scaled  problem,  i.e.  when  ||grad||
(which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
magnitude different from the desired step.

Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,
then  it  will  decrease step length by 2 (up to 20 attempts) and will get
10^44, which is still too large.

This function allows us to tell than line search should  be  started  from
some moderate step length, like 1.0, so algorithm will be able  to  detect
desired step length in a several searches.

Default behavior (when no step is suggested) is to use preconditioner,  if
it is available, to generate initial estimate of step length.

This function influences only first iteration of algorithm. It  should  be
called between MinCGCreate/MinCGRestartFrom() call and MinCGOptimize call.
Suggested step is ignored if you have preconditioner.

   Be careful to choose variant of MinCGOptimize()  which  corresponds  to

This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied

(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with mincgoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.
      
      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.
      
      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.
      
      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.
  
=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

/*************************************************************************
Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* mincgoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* mincgoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================
    
Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* mincgoptguardnonc1test0results()
* mincgoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.
      
      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.
      
      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

Nonsmoothness (non-C1) test #0 studies  function  values  (not  gradient!)

derivative estimate.

This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
numerical differentiation.

Two reports are returned:

  value of the nonsmoothness indicator
* a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
  evaluations, and thus is more detailed

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function

Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.
