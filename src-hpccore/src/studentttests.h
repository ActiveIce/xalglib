One-sample t-test

This test checks three hypotheses about the mean of the given sample.  The
following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is equal  to  the  given
      value)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  mean  is  greater  than  or
      equal to the given value)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is less than or  equal
      to the given value).

The test is based on the assumption that  a  given  sample  has  a  normal
distribution and  an  unknown  dispersion.  If  the  distribution  sharply
differs from normal, the test will work incorrectly.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N       -   size of sample, N>=0
    Mean    -   assumed value of the mean.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

NOTE: this function correctly handles degenerate cases:
      * when N=0, all p-values are set to 1.0
      * when variance of X[] is exactly zero, p-values are set
        to 1.0 or 0.0, depending on difference between sample mean and
        value of mean being tested.

Two-sample pooled test

This test checks three hypotheses about the mean of the given samples. The
following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the means are equal)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean of the first sample  is

    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean of the first sample is
      less than or equal to the mean of the second sample).

Test is based on the following assumptions:
    * given samples have normal distributions
    * dispersions are equal
    * samples are independent.

NOTE: this function correctly handles degenerate cases:
      * when N=0 or M=0, all p-values are set to 1.0
      * when both samples has exactly zero variance, p-values are set

This test checks three hypotheses about the mean of the given samples. The

      * when both samples has zero variance, p-values are set

      * when only one sample has zero variance, test reduces to 1-sample
        version.
