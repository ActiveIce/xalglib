Algorithm for solving the following generalized symmetric positive-definite
eigenproblem:
    A*x = lambda*B*x (1) or
    A*B*x = lambda*x (2) or
    B*A*x = lambda*x (3).
where A is a symmetric matrix, B - symmetric positive-definite matrix.
The problem is solved by reducing it to an ordinary  symmetric  eigenvalue
problem.

Input parameters:
    A           -   symmetric matrix which is given by its upper or lower
                    triangular part.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N           -   size of matrices A and B.
    IsUpperA    -   storage format of matrix A.
    B           -   symmetric positive-definite matrix which is given by
                    its upper or lower triangular part.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    IsUpperB    -   storage format of matrix B.
    ZNeeded     -   if ZNeeded is equal to:
                     * 0, the eigenvectors are not returned;
                     * 1, the eigenvectors are returned.
    ProblemType -   if ProblemType is equal to:
                     * 1, the following problem is solved: A*x = lambda*B*x;
                     * 2, the following problem is solved: A*B*x = lambda*x;
                     * 3, the following problem is solved: B*A*x = lambda*x.

Output parameters:
    D           -   eigenvalues in ascending order.
                    Array whose index ranges within [0..N-1].
    Z           -   if ZNeeded is equal to:
                     * 0, Z hasn't changed;
                     * 1, Z contains eigenvectors.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
                    The eigenvectors are stored in matrix columns. It should
                    be noted that the eigenvectors in such problems do not
                    form an orthogonal system.

Result:
    True, if the problem was solved successfully.
    False, if the error occurred during the Cholesky decomposition of matrix
    B (the matrix isn't positive-definite) or during the work of the iterative
    algorithm for solving the symmetric eigenproblem.

Algorithm for reduction of the following generalized symmetric positive-
definite eigenvalue problem:
    A*x = lambda*B*x (1) or
    A*B*x = lambda*x (2) or
    B*A*x = lambda*x (3)
to the symmetric eigenvalues problem C*y = lambda*y (eigenvalues of this and
the given problems are the same, and the eigenvectors of the given problem
could be obtained by multiplying the obtained eigenvectors by the
transformation matrix x = R*y).

Here A is a symmetric matrix, B - symmetric positive-definite matrix.

Input parameters:
    A           -   symmetric matrix which is given by its upper or lower
                    triangular part.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N           -   size of matrices A and B.
    IsUpperA    -   storage format of matrix A.
    B           -   symmetric positive-definite matrix which is given by
                    its upper or lower triangular part.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    IsUpperB    -   storage format of matrix B.
    ProblemType -   if ProblemType is equal to:
                     * 1, the following problem is solved: A*x = lambda*B*x;
                     * 2, the following problem is solved: A*B*x = lambda*x;
                     * 3, the following problem is solved: B*A*x = lambda*x.

Output parameters:
    A           -   symmetric matrix which is given by its upper or lower
                    triangle depending on IsUpperA. Contains matrix C.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    R           -   upper triangular or low triangular transformation matrix
                    which is used to obtain the eigenvectors of a given problem
                    as the product of eigenvectors of C (from the right) and
                    matrix R (from the left). If the matrix is upper
                    triangular, the elements below the main diagonal
                    are equal to 0 (and vice versa). Thus, we can perform
                    the multiplication without taking into account the
                    internal structure (which is an easier though less
                    effective way).
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    IsUpperR    -   type of matrix R (upper or lower triangular).

Result:
    True, if the problem was reduced successfully.
    False, if the error occurred during the Cholesky decomposition of
        matrix B (the matrix is not positive-definite).
