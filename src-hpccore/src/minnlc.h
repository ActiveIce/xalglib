TERMINATION CODES

TerminationType field contains completion code, which can be either:

=== FAILURE CODE ===
  -8    internal integrity control detected  infinite  or  NAN  values  in
        function/gradient, recovery was impossible.  Abnormal  termination
        signaled.
  -3    box  constraints  are  infeasible.  Note: infeasibility of non-box
        constraints does NOT trigger emergency  completion;  you  have  to
        examine  bcerr/lcerr/nlcerr   to  detect   possibly   inconsistent
        constraints.

=== SUCCESS CODE ===
   2    relative step is no more than EpsX.
   5    MaxIts steps was taken
   7    stopping conditions are too stringent,
        further improvement is impossible,
        X contains best point found so far.
   8    user requested algorithm termination via minnlcrequesttermination(),
        last accepted point is returned
                       
=== ADDITIONAL CODES ===
* +800      if   during   algorithm   execution   the   solver encountered
            NAN/INF values in the target or  constraints  but  managed  to
            recover by reducing trust region radius,  the  solver  returns
            one of SUCCESS codes but adds +800 to the code.

                  NONLINEARLY  CONSTRAINED  OPTIMIZATION

DESCRIPTION:
The  subroutine  minimizes a function  F(x)  of N arguments subject to the
any combination of the:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints
* nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
* nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)<=0

REQUIREMENTS:
* the user must provide callback calculating F(), H(), G()  -  either both
  value and gradient, or merely a value (numerical differentiation will be
  used)
* F(), G(), H() are continuously differentiable on the  feasible  set  and
  its neighborhood
* starting point X0, which can be infeasible

USAGE:

Here we give the very brief outline  of  the MinNLC optimizer. We strongly
recommend you to study examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read
ALGLIB User Guide: https://www.alglib.net/nonlinear-programming/

1. The user initializes the solver with minnlccreate() or  minnlccreates()
   (the latter is used for numerical  differentiation)  call  and  chooses
   which NLC solver to use.
   
   In the current release the following solvers can be used:
   
   * sparse large-scale filter-based SQP solver, recommended  for problems
     of any size (from several variables to thousands  of  variables).
     Activated with minnlcsetalgosqp() function.
     
   * dense SQP-BFGS solver, recommended  for small-scale problems  (up  to
     several hundreds of variables) with a very expensive target function.
     Requires less function  evaluations than any other  solver,  but  has
     very expensive iteration.
     Activated with minnlcsetalgosqpbfgs() function.
     
   * several other solvers, including legacy ones

2. [optional] user activates OptGuard  integrity checker  which  tries  to
   detect possible errors in the user-supplied callbacks:
   * discontinuity/nonsmoothness of the target/nonlinear constraints
   * errors in the analytic gradient provided by user
   This feature is essential for early prototyping stages because it helps
   to catch common coding and problem statement errors.
   OptGuard can be activated with following functions (one per each  check
   performed):
   * minnlcoptguardsmoothness()
   * minnlcoptguardgradient()

3. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
   of calling one of the following functions:
   a) minnlcsetbc() for boundary constraints
   b) minnlcsetlc() for linear constraints
   c) minnlcsetnlc2() for nonlinear constraints
   You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.
   
4. User sets scale of the variables with minnlcsetscale() function. It  is
   VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
   constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

5. User sets stopping conditions with minnlcsetcond3() or minnlcsetcond().
   If NLC solver uses inner/outer  iteration  layout,  this  function sets
   stopping conditions for INNER iterations.
   
6. Finally, user calls minnlcoptimize()  function  which  takes  algorithm
   state and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates
   F/G/H.

7. User calls  minnlcresults()  to  get  solution;  additionally  you  can
   retrieve OptGuard report with minnlcoptguardresults(), and get detailed
   report about purported errors in the target function with:
   * minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
   * minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()

8. Optionally user may call minnlcrestartfrom() to solve  another  problem
   with same N but another starting point. minnlcrestartfrom()  allows  to
   reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

/*************************************************************************
This subroutine is a finite  difference variant of MinNLCCreate(). It uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to this  function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinNLCCreate() in order to get more
information about creation of NLC optimizer.

CALLBACK PARALLELISM

The MINNLC optimizer supports parallel parallel  numerical differentiation
('callback parallelism'). This feature, which  is  present  in  commercial
ALGLIB  editions,  greatly   accelerates   optimization   with   numerical
differentiation of an expensive target functions.

Callback parallelism is usually  beneficial  when  computing  a  numerical
gradient requires more than several  milliseconds.  In this case  the  job
of computing individual gradient components can be split between  multiple
threads. Even inexpensive targets can benefit  from  parallelism,  if  you
have many variables.

ALGLIB Reference Manual, 'Working with commercial  version' section, tells
how to activate callback parallelism for your programming language.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinNLCSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large TRUNCATION  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large NUMERICAL  errors.  1.0E-4  can  be  good
   value to start from.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less   robust   and  precise.  Imprecise  gradient  may  slow  down
   convergence, especially on highly nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

In fact, this function sets  only  constraints  COUNT  and  their  BOUNDS.
Constraints  themselves  (constraint  functions)   are   passed   to   the

NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If

        constraints. Inappropriate scaling  of nonlinear  constraints  may
        ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  "1000*G0(x)=0"
        is NOT the same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".
           
        It means that YOU are  the  one who is responsible for the correct
        scaling of the nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend
        you to scale nonlinear constraints in such a way that the Jacobian
        rows have approximately unit magnitude  (for  problems  with  unit
        scale) or have magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i] (where S is
        a scale set by MinNLCSetScale() function).

(1999)" by D.GOLDFARB,  R.POLYAK,  K. SCHEINBERG,  I.YUZEFOVICH  with  the

AUL solver can be significantly faster than SQP on easy  problems  due  to
cheaper iterations, although it needs more function evaluations. On large-
scale sparse problems one iteration of the AUL solver usually  costs  tens
times less than one iteration of the SQP solver.

However, the SQP solver is more robust than the AUL. In particular, it  is
much better at constraint enforcement and will  never escape feasible area
after constraints were successfully enforced.  It  also  needs  much  less
target function evaluations.

This   function  tells  MinNLC  optimizer  to  use  SLP (Successive Linear
Programming) algorithm for  nonlinearly  constrained   optimization.  This
algorithm  is  a  slight  modification  of  one  described  in  "A  Linear
programming-based optimization algorithm for solving nonlinear programming
problems" (2010) by Claus Still and Tapio Westerlund.

This solver is one of the slowest  in  ALGLIB,  it  requires  more  target
function evaluations that SQP and AUL. However it is somewhat more  robust
in tricky cases, so it can be used as a backup  plan  for low  dimensional
problems.

We recommend to use this algo when SQP/AUL solvers do not work. If  trying
different approach gives the same results, then MAYBE something  is  wrong
with your optimization problem.

Despite its name ("linear" = "first order method") this algorithm performs
steps similar to that of conjugate gradients method;  internally  it  uses
orthogonality/conjugacy requirement for subsequent steps  which  makes  it
closer to second order methods in terms of convergence speed.

Convergence is proved for the following case:
* function and constraints are continuously differentiable (C1 class)
* extended Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification  (EMFCQ)  holds;
  in the context of this algorithm EMFCQ  means  that  one  can,  for  any
  infeasible  point,  find  a  search  direction  such that the constraint
  infeasibilities are reduced.

This algorithm has following nice properties:
* no parameters to tune
* no convexity requirements for target function or constraints
* initial point can be infeasible
* algorithm respects box constraints in all intermediate points  (it  does
  not even evaluate function outside of box constrained area)
* once linear constraints are enforced, algorithm will not violate them
* no such guarantees can be provided for nonlinear constraints,  but  once
  nonlinear constraints are enforced, algorithm will try  to  respect them
  as much as possible
* numerical differentiation does not  violate  box  constraints  (although
  general linear and nonlinear ones can be violated during differentiation)
* from our experience, this algorithm is somewhat more  robust  in  really
  difficult cases

===== TRACING SLP SOLVER =================================================

SLP solver supports advanced tracing capabilities. You can trace algorithm
output by specifying following trace symbols (case-insensitive)  by  means
of trace_file() call:
* 'SLP'         - for basic trace of algorithm  steps and decisions.  Only
                  short scalars (function values and deltas) are  printed.
                  N-dimensional quantities like search directions are  NOT
                  printed.
                  It also prints OptGuard  integrity  checker  report when
                  nonsmoothness of target/constraints is suspected.
* 'SLP.DETAILED'- for output of points being visited and search directions
                  This  symbol  also  implicitly  defines  'SLP'. You  can
                  control output format by additionally specifying:
                  * nothing     to output in  6-digit exponential format
                  * 'PREC.E15'  to output in 15-digit exponential format
                  * 'PREC.F6'   to output in  6-digit fixed-point format
* 'SLP.PROBING' - to let algorithm insert additional function  evaluations
                  before line search  in  order  to  build  human-readable
                  chart of the raw  Lagrangian  (~40  additional  function
                  evaluations is performed for  each  line  search).  This
                  symbol also implicitly defines 'SLP'. Definition of this
                  symbol also automatically activates OptGuard  smoothness
                  monitor.
* 'OPTGUARD'    - for report of smoothness/continuity violations in target
                  and/or constraints. This kind of reporting is   included
                  in 'SLP', but it comes with lots of additional info.  If
                  you  need  just  smoothness  monitoring,   specify  this
                  setting.
                  
                  NOTE: this tag merely directs  OptGuard  output  to  log
                        file. Even if you specify it, you  still  have  to
                        configure OptGuard  by calling minnlcoptguard...()
                        family of functions.

By default trace is disabled and adds  no  overhead  to  the  optimization
process. However, specifying any of the symbols adds some  formatting  and
output-related   overhead.  Specifying  'SLP.PROBING'  adds   even  larger
overhead due to additional function evaluations being performed.

You may specify multiple symbols by separating them with commas:

CALLBACK PARALLELISM

The MINNLC optimizer supports parallel parallel  numerical differentiation
('callback parallelism'). This feature, which  is  present  in  commercial
ALGLIB  editions,  greatly   accelerates   optimization   with   numerical
differentiation of an expensive target functions.

Callback parallelism is usually  beneficial  when  computing  a  numerical
gradient requires more than several  milliseconds.  In this case  the  job
of computing individual gradient components can be split between  multiple
threads. Even inexpensive targets can benefit  from  parallelism,  if  you
have many variables.

ALGLIB Reference Manual, 'Working with commercial  version' section, tells
how to activate callback parallelism for your programming language.

NOTES:

1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
   (analytical) user-supplied Jacobian, and one which uses  only  function
   vector and numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
   gradient.

   Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
   you should choose appropriate variant of MinNLCOptimize() -  one  which
   accepts function AND Jacobian or one which accepts ONLY function.

   Be careful to choose variant of MinNLCOptimize()  which  corresponds to
   your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic gradient/Jacobian.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target  function  (constraints)  at  the
initial point (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the final
point) and compares numerical gradient/Jacobian with analytic one provided
by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which stores both gradients/Jacobians, and specific components highlighted
as suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minnlcoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.
           
           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.
      
INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep>0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.
                    
                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minnlcsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================                    

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0) and/or constraints
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1) and/or constraints

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.
      
      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.
      
      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.
      
      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.
                      This kind of monitoring does not work well with  SQP
                      because SQP solver needs just 1-2 function evaluations
                      per step, which is not enough for OptGuard  to  make
                      any conclusions.
  
=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

/*************************************************************************
Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minnlcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minnlcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient/Jacobian is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient/Jacobian
  * rep.badgradnum, reference gradient/Jacobian obtained via numerical
    differentiation
* rep.nonc0suspected, and additionally:
  * rep.nonc0fidx - an index of specific function violating C0 continuity
* rep.nonc1suspected, and additionally
  * rep.nonc1fidx - an index of specific function violating C1 continuity
Here function index 0 means  target function, index 1  or  higher  denotes
nonlinear constraints.

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================
    
Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.
      
      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.
      
      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.
