Wilcoxon signed-rank test

This test checks three hypotheses about the median  of  the  given sample.
The following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median is equal to the  given
      value)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median is  greater  than  or
      equal to the given value)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis  -  the  median  is  less than or
      equal to the given value)

Requirements:
    * the scale of measurement should be ordinal, interval or  ratio (i.e.
      the test could not be applied to nominal variables).
    * the distribution should be continuous and symmetric relative to  its
      median.
    * number of distinct values in the X array should be greater than 4

The test is non-parametric and doesn't require distribution X to be normal

Input parameters:
    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N       -   size of the sample.
    Median  -   assumed median value.

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

To calculate p-values, special approximation is used. This method lets  us
calculate p-values with two decimal places in interval [0.0001, 1].

"Two decimal places" does not sound very impressive, but in  practice  the
relative error of less than 1% is enough to make a decision.

There is no approximation outside the [0.0001, 1] interval. Therefore,  if
the significance level outlies this interval, the test returns 0.0001.
