Two-sample F-test

This test checks three hypotheses about dispersions of the given  samples.
The following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the dispersions are equal)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis  -  the  dispersion  of  the first
      sample is greater than or equal to  the  dispersion  of  the  second
      sample).
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  dispersion  of  the  first
      sample is less than or equal to the dispersion of the second sample)

The test is based on the following assumptions:
    * the given samples have normal distributions
    * the samples are independent.

Input parameters:
    X   -   sample 1. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N   -   sample size.
    Y   -   sample 2. Array whose index goes from 0 to M-1.
    M   -   sample size.

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
